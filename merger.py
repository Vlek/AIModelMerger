"""
AI model merger for weighted merge.

This is an algorithm that allows one to specify the models and their weights
such that they can be used in another algorithm to merge them two by two and
have each model appear in the total merged model in the requested percentages.

Example:

    input: {"model a": 0.25, "model b": 0.25, "model c": 0.50}
    output: same as input


NOTE:
    This is merely the algorithm that should be used, it is up to those
    attempting to create AI images to apply this to their scripts by taking out
    the portion that is saving the information into merged_models.
