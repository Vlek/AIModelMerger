TODO: Ensure that the merges do not cause there to be any
      off-by-one exceptions, do not want it to hide the fact that
      it "stole" any percentage from another model.
      I'm worried here that there could be a merge that slightly
      crowds another, and, that crowding would not be detectable
      in the overall numbers.
